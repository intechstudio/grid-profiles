# Profiles & Presets
You can find here the first profiles and presets made by intechstudio to explore creative options with Grid. These configurations can be shared, edited and stored on your harddrive. 

*We develop an open profile platform, where users can interact with these profiles in the cloud. Stay tuned!*

## Get Started

Each profile or preset has it's own folder here on GitHub with a description written in the file's description field, about what it can do and how you can use it.
> Some profiles are generic, some are made to be used with DAW or other software.

Both profiles and presets are .json files. Profiles represent one page on one module. A preset is for unique control element.
> Example: 1st Page of a PBF4 module

The profiles and presets can be made and edited with the Grid Editor software.
> Change the color of a LED by selecting a control element's init event and rewrite the red-gre-blu variables to 255 0 0. This sets the LED red!

When you finish loading or editing the profile store your configuration onto the module.
> Once a configuration is stored, you no longer need Grid Editor running.
